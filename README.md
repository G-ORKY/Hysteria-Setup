:computer: ！！！Only for the server without any deployed nginx server, cause this script will replace the nginx.conf in convenience.

Run Setup.sh to start.

PLEASE!!PLEASE!! Remenber to BACKUP your original nginx.conf if you have the demand!

Or you can choose the option that you do not need to use the auto page set-up function to use your original page to obtain a cert for hysteria.

Btw, this script is temporary for single-user setup.

For more functions you wish to add to this script, feel free to contribute to this project or contact our contributers.

auto cert renew will be added recently!
port leap will be added recently!
